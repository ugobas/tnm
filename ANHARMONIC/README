This folder contains scripts and data relative to the paper "Why are large conformational changes well described by harmonic normal modes?" 
by Y. Dehouck and U. Bastolla (Biophysical Journal, under revision). It contains the files:
1) script_confchange.pl is a perl script for running the TNM program onto a set of conformational changes either locally or on a computer cluster,
for specified choice of degrees of freedom (PHI, PHIPSI, OMEGA or SIDECHAIN) and torsional regularization.
2) List.in is a list of initial and final strctures of the conformational change and corresponding chain label (ALL for considering all chains in the PDB file)
The corresponding pdb files must be stored in the folder PDBPATH
3) Input_TNM.in is a sample configuration file for the TNM program. The script modifies the pdb file names and the parameters with degrees of freedom,
contact threshold and torsional regularizations, which are commented in the file and must be uncommented for use without the script.
4) script_read_confchange.pl is a perl script that reads the TNM results, stored in a different folder for each set of parameters (degrees of freedom and
torsional regularization), and outputs tables for individual proteins and averaged over all proteins.
5) Table_confchange.zip is a zip archive with the tables obtained with the above script
