General description
==========================
The program tnm computes the normal modes of protein structure <pdb1> in the space of torsion angles and other relevant internal coordinates such as inter-chain rigid body degrees of freedom and pseudo-bonds between protein regions separated by disordered loops. These normal modes are used for computing statistical mechanics in the harmonic approximation.

The analysis performed includes:

- Print normal modes as movies in PDB files (if specified by the user) and as vectors of Cartesian and torsional displacements.
- Predict residue-specific flexibility (B factors)
- Simulate ensembles of structures with predefined amplitudes and anharmonic energy below a threshold
- Predict structural effects of all possible mutations: RMSD from wild-type structure and energy barrier between mutated structure and wild-type one.
- Predict dynamical couplings for all residues, such as for predicting the fluctuations of inter-residue distances
- Predict dynamical couplings between and among residues in binding sites specified in the PDB or specified in an external file
- Perform anharmonicity analysis for all normal modes

- For a conformational change (two pdb structures with similar sequence):
- Correlation between conformational change and predicted dynamics at the level of Cartesian fluctuations, torsional fluctuations and projections on normal modes, and deviation from the null model of linear response that suggests if the conformation change is functional.
- If the two sequences are related by the specified number of mutations, it estimates the mutational parameters that produces the observed conformational change and predicts the conformational change produced with the input mutational parameters.

----------------------
3A) GENERAL

If LABEL=1 the program prints the model param. in the names of output files.
The program prints a self-explanatory summary of the results in the <>_summary.dat file.

The force constant of the model is fitted from the B-factors, if present, modelling B-factors from the contribution of rigid-body degrees of freedom (9 fitted parameters) plus internal fluctuations (1 additional parameter, inversely proportional to the force constant) and regularizing the fit through our method of rescaled ridge regression (Dehouck and Bastolla Integr Biol 2017 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28555214/).

Predicted mean square fluctuations of all residues are printed in the <>_MSF.dat file together with observed and predicted B factors.
Mean square fluctuations of torsion angles are printed in the <>_MSF_tors.dat file.
If requested, the contact matrix is printed in the .cm file.

If requested, anharmonic analysis is performed for all modes, moving the conformation along the normal mode, computing its anharmonic energy, and computing the Boltzmann average of the normal mode coordinate using the anharmonic energy as Boltzmann weight and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the harmonic and anharmonic weights. The summary analysis and the analysis of conformational changes is performed both with the harmonic and with the anharmonic ensemble. These computations are slow and they do not improve the results, so ANHARMONIC=0 is reccomended

......................................................
3B) NORMAL MODES
The user can specify the number of printed *normal modes* with the option NMODES=<value> (default is zero).
The modes are printed as movies in PDB files if PRINT_PDB=1 (default is 0) as snapshots with at least RMSD_STEP=<value> (default 0.4) RMSD from the previous one until the maximum amplitude AMPLITUDE=<value> or until the repulsion energy reaches E_THR=<value>.

The file <>_Modes.dat reports several properties of each normal mode: contribution to thermal fluctuations individual and cumulative, contribution to the analyzed conformation change (if any, see below) computed through rescaled ridge regression individual and cumulative, inverse frequency squared omega^(-2), RMSD produced by the normal mode, collectivity (fraction of degrees of freedom displaced by the mode computed as exponential of the Shannon entropy divided by the number of degrees of freedom) in Cartesian space, torsion space mass-weighted, and torsion space, and maximum deviation produced by the normal mode, which is correlated with the RMSD.

...........................................
3C) SIMULATED CONFORMATIONS

The program prints SIMUL=<value> (default zero) conformations sampled from the TNM ensemble for different amplitudes (in units of the predicted thermal fluctuations) from AMPL_MIN=<value> to AMPL_MAX=<value> increasing by the factor AMPL_FACT=<value>. Each simulated amplitude is printed in the <>_AMPL_simul.pdb file.

The generated conformations are tested for their anharmonic energy (for all contributing normal modes) and printed only if the anharmonic Boltzmann weight is larger than 1./(4*SIMUL) (i.e. they are not extreme outliers of the Bolzmann ensemble with SIMUL simulated structures) and the RMSD is not smaller than 0.1 of the expected RMSD under the prescribed amplitude. If for some amplitude the acceptance rate is smaller than 0.02 the program stops the computation. The properties of all simulated structures (RMSD, energy, number of contributing modes), accepted or not, are printed in the <>_AMPL_simul.dat file.

.............................................................
3D) ANALYSIS OF CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES

The user can specify a *conformational change* by providing the input to a second PDB (PDB2=<path_to_second_pdb>, CH2=<chain>). The sequences of the two proteins are aligned and the structures of the aligned residues are optimally superimposed. The program exits if the resulting RMSD is smaller than RMSD_MIN set by RMSD_MIN=<value> (default 0.5).
If PRINT_CHANGE=1 is specified the program prints a pdb file with the path of the conformational change generated only through displacements in torsion angles and inter-chain degrees of freedom. 

Given the Cartesian conformational change for all reference atoms, the program computes the torsional conformational change based on 4 methods: (1) Difference of torsion angles without considering bond angles; (2) Ordinary least square fit; (3) Rescaled ridge regression of type M (maximum penalty); (4) Rescaled ridge regression of type Cv (specific heat). By far the best results are obtained with rescaled ridge regression, while results obtained with (1) and (2) often do not make sense but they are reported for completeness.

The Summary file reports the correlation of the projections of the torsional conformation changes on the torsional normal modes, c_alpha, with the normal mode frequencies omega_alpha, r[c^2,1/w^2], and the excess correlations with respect to the null-model expectation based on linear response theory, r[(c*w)^2,1/w^2], with the corresponding significance, Significance(Z), which can be interpreted as evidence that the conformational change is target of natural selection. The number of normal modes that effectively contribute to the conformational change are reported as Recp.Coll(cc) and the mode that contributes most is reported as Most_contr.mode(cc).
If PRINT_FORCE=1 is specified the program prints as a PDB file the force that is required to generate the torsional conformation change computed with method (4).

................................................
3E) PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS OF MUTATION

If PRED_MUT=1, the program predicts the effect of all possible mutation in terms of predicted RMSD of the mutated structure (<>_mut_RMSD.dat) and predicted harmonic energy barrier between the wild-type structure and the mutated structure (<>_mut_DE.dat). In these files, every line represents the mutated amino acid, its number of native contacts and 20 additional columns with the predicted effect of the mutation.
The file <>_mut_all.dat represents the scatter plot of RMSD and DE for all possible mutations.
The file <>_mut_prof_RMSD.dat contains the profile of the resulting structural deviations at every site averaged over the 19*L simulated mutations.

The program TNM models mutations as perturbations present at all contacts formed by the mutated residue. The perturbation is a combination of the change of residue size, the change of contact stability and the change of the optimal distance of the contact. The three coefficients of this combination are given in the inpiut file MUT_PARA=<file> while the 210 possible changes are parameterized internally. The command MUT_PARA=<file> allows to change the mutation parameters in <file> (default Mutation_para.in, provided with the package).

If an input conformational change is the result of a mutation in the primary sequence, the program predicts the structural effect of the mutation (only if the number of mutated amino acids equals to NMUT set by NMUT=<value>, unless NMUT=-1, in which case the prediction is performed in any case). The effect of the mutation can be predicted through the parameters set in MUT_PARA, or the program can internally compute the optimal coefficients that maximize the cosine between the observed and predicted conformational change.

.........................................................
3F) DYNAMICAL COUPLINGS

The program can be used to compute *dynamical couplings* between all pairs of C-alpha atoms. To this effect ALLOSTERY=1 must be specified. Implemented couplings: (A) deformation coupling (extent by which a perturbation at a residue i modifies the local structure of residue j), computed if PRINT_ALLO_COUPLING=1 and printed in <>_deformation_coupling.dat. (B) Directionality coupling (Boltzmann average of the scalar product of the directions of motions of two residues) computed if PRINT_DIR_COUPLING= 1 and printed in <>_directionality_coupling.dat (C) Coordination coupling (1- 0.5*fluctuation of the interatomic distance) computed if PRINT_COORD_COUPLING=1 and printed in <>_coordination_coupling.dat. If ALL_PAIRS=1, couplings are printed for all pairs, otherwise only values that exceed the mean coupling plus SIGMA times the standard deviation are printed. The default value is SIGMA=1.0. In the coupling file, each residue is labeled by an integer number. The correspondence between labels and residue number, residue type and chain label is reported in the file <>_names.dat.

For each coupling, the program can print the corresponding *profile* (one value for each residue) set by PROF_TYPE=<value>, allowed: A (average, obtained by averaging all couplings of the residue), P (principal eigenvector), C (effective connectivity). The profiles are printed in the files <>_profiles.dat

It is possible to specify a list of *functional sites* in the file specified by SITES=<file>. If no file is specified, the binding sites reported in teh PDB file are used, if present. For each binding site, the average couplings between the residues that belong to the site are reported, as well as their P-value (fraction of 1000 randomly generated sites with coupling larger than the functional site), in the file <>_binding_sites.dat, and the average couplings between residues of two different sites and the corresponding P-values are reported in the file <>_pairs_sites.dat

Custom settings: MODEL
----------------------------------------------
The following settings can be modified by the user by editing the configuration file. The best results are obtained with the default settings.

PDB CHAIN
..........
The analyzed structure is set by providing the path of the PDB file as PDB1=<local_path_to_pdb>. The program considers either the first chain in the PDB file (default), a specified chain (e.g. CH1=B), a set of chains (e.g. CH1=ABCDE), or all chains in the PDB (CH1=ALL).

DEGREES OF FREEDOM
...................
The user can select the *degrees of freedom* that are allowed to move. Besides rigid body degrees of freedom between different chains and between parts of the same chain separated by a disordered loop, these are main chain torsion angles phi and psi (default), only phi (PSI=0), also main-chain omega angle (OMEGA=1), also side-chain torsion angles (SIDECHAIN=1). Side chain degrees of freedom are considered only if they are constrained by at least MIN_INT contacts (default 1). Counter-intuitively, the fewer the degrees of freedom (PSI=0) the better the results.

REFERENCE ATOMS FOR KINETIC ENERGY COMPUTATION
...............................................
The user can select the *reference atoms* that are used to compute the kinetic energy and the Eckart conditions that eliminat global rigid body degrees of freedom. The default is all heavy atoms (REF=ALL), allowed choices are extended backbone atoms (REF=EB i.e. N-CA-C-O-CB), strict backbone atoms (REF=BB i.e. N-CA-C), only beta-carbons (REF=CB C-alpha for Glycine) or only alpha-carbons (REF=CA). The best results are obtained with the default (all atoms).

CONTACT DEFINITION
......................
The *potential energy* is computed based on native contacts computed with all atoms, considering only the pair of atoms at minimum distance for a given pair of residue (CONT_TYPE=MIN, default), based on all atoms, with more than one pair of interacting atoms for each pair of residues (CONT_TYPE=ALL), based on C-beta atoms (CONT_TYPE=CB, C-alpha is used for Glycine), based on C-alpha atoms (CONT_TYPE=CA), based on screened interactions (CONT_TYPE=DIR), based on a model that scores differently the hydrogen bonds (CONT_TYPE=HB) or based on the elastic network model by Hinsen (CONT_TYPE=HNM). The best results are obtained with the MIN scheme. The threshold for the contact cut-off can be set through the CONT_THR=<value> record, default 4.5. The force constant is modelled as a decreasing power of the distance of the interacting atoms in the PDB structure with exponent set by EXP_HESSIAN=<value> (default is 6, which gives the best results).

TORSIONAL SPRINGS
....................
The elastic constants of the flexible degrees of freedom can be set by K_PHI=, K_PSI=, K_OMEGA=, K_CHI= for torsion angles and K_BL=, K_BA= for bond lengths and bond angles.

GLOBAL FORCE CONSTANT PARAMETER
................................
The amplitude of the normal modes at the temperature of the computation are set by the rescaled ridge regression fit of the experimental B-factors with the atomic fluctuations predicted by the model if FIT_B=1 is specified, otherwise they are internally computed with default values of the force constant if FIT_B=0 or if B-factors are absent. Better results are obtained with FIT_B=1.

AVOID ZERO EIGENVALUES AND MODES THAT MOVE TOO FEW ATOMS
.........................................................
To avoid vanishing eigenvalues due to numerical errors, normal modes are discarded if their eigenvalue is omega^2 < E_MIN <omega^2> (the mean value of the eigenvalue for all modes). Default is E_MIN=0.0000001. Modes with low collectivity that move fewer than COLL_THR Cartesian degrees of freedom are discarded (default is COLL_THR=80 roughly corresponding to 4 residues when REF=ALL atoms. This parameter has not been really optimized).

Compilation
===========
To compile, save into your chosen installation directory and run
>unzip tnm.zip
>make
(you may want to change the compilation options in the Makefile)
>cp tnm /bin/
(copy to a binary files directory contained in your PATH, as specified for instance in the ~/.tcshrc file)

RUNNING FROM COMMAND LINE
===========================
Fast way to run the program, but not all capabilities are enabled.
It is reccomended to run the program with configuration file (see below)

Use the program to compute normal modes of one or more chains:

>tnm -p1 <pdb1> -c1 <chain1> -modes <nmodes>

The program computes tnm modes of chain <chain1> (default: first chain)
of pdb file and prints the <nmodes> (default: 0) lowest modes in multi-pdb
files and as torsional and cartesian components.
If -c1 ALL is used, all chains are used to compute normal modes.

Use the program to project the conformation change from <pdb1> to <pdb2> onto
the normal modes of <pdb1>:

>tnm -p1 <pdb1> -c1 <ch1> -p2 <pdb2> -c2 <ch2> -modes <nmodes>

The program outputs a summary of the projection in a file called
Summary_<....>.dat, mode by mode projections in <...>.dat, and the
<nmodes> lowest normal modes.
